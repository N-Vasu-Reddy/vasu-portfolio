PROJECTS 
COVID-19 Data Analysis 
• 
Built an end-to-end machine learning solution using Python and Jupyter Notebook for predicting California 
housing prices, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and 
serialization. 
• 
Integrated a Flask-based web interface for real-time user input and price prediction, and implemented a 
deployment-ready architecture combining backend inference with dynamic frontend templates. 
California House price Prediction 
• 
Pre-processed the California housing dataset and performed feature engineering before training a Ridge 
Regression model for accurate price prediction and performed model evaluation to ensure reliability. 
• 
Deployed the trained model locally using Flask and .pkl files, creating a dynamic web interface that enabled 
real-time predictions based on user input. 
Named Entity Recognition 
• 
Built a Named Entity Recognition system using a BiLSTM model trained with Keras, leveraging token and tag 
mappings for sequence labeling. Prepared and preprocessed data, encoded tokens, and saved the trained 
model along with necessary dictionaries. 
• 
Developed a Flask web application to deploy the NER model locally, enabling real-time entity extraction from 
user input. Integrated model loading, preprocessing, prediction, and result display through a 
clean HTML interface.
